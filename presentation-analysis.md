# Analysis

Pick two presentations from the internet (I recommend TED Talks, but any presentation is suitable)
and analyze the presenter's mannerism, how the message is delivered, the structure of the presentation,
the use of visual aids, audience interaction, whether any notes were used, how was the audience's attention kept up.
