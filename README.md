# Presentation

## Story

A presentation is a means of communicating a message to an audience.
As such, we need to understand our audience, and adapt our communication style and presentation structure to sway them.

You would like to implement some change in how your team works or want them to adapt a new technology.
You know your audience well, so you pick a slow Friday afternoon in order to not disturb their workflow.

Your team reached a milestone, and you wish to present it to the whole company at a quarterly meeting.
You have a ten-minute slot and your audience does not know much about your team's responsibilities.

You were asked to talk at a conference, in front of hundreds of people and you need to fill an hour-long spot.
As you represent your company, you must be careful about how you present yourself.

We will learn about how to adapt our presentation to different situations and manage our nerves in order to deliver our message effectively.

## What are you going to learn?

- Understand the building blocks of a great presentation.
- Manage presentation nerves.

## Tasks

1. Attend the `Presentation` workshop in the course of your studies (Look for the next event in the student calendar.)
    - The student attended the Presentation workshop.

2. Pick two presentations from the internet (I recommend TED Talks, but any presentation is suitable) and analyze the presenter's mannerisms, their delivery, the structure of the presentation, the use of visual aids, audience interactions, whether any notes were used, and the way the audience's attention was maintained.
    - A complete Analysis in the `presentation-analysis.md` is filled in.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Know your audience. A presentation is about delivering a message effectively to a particular audience.
- If you care about your message and can deliver it authentically, the audience will be more responsive towards it.
- Respect the time constraints of the presentation and the time of the audience.
- Use slides to aid you, instead of explaining what is on the slides.
